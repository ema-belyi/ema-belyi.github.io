<main>I was born in a small town called Kostanay. I went to a Russian kindergarten, so it was a little difficult for me to study in a Kazakh school. However, I had a greater interest in knowledge, which helped me a lot in learning. From the 1st to the 6th grade, I studied at the 8th school. It was a Russian school, and my class was the first Kazakh class in this school. So a lot was expected of us. In a short time, we have become a demonstration class in our parallel. We studied well and were quite ambitious, fun guys. From the 4th grade, my parents told me about entering the Kazakh-Turkish Lyceum. Therefore, I already knew from the 4th grade that starting from the 7th grade I would be studying in a new, more promising school. Starting from the 6th grade, I began to prepare for admission to a new school. I went to the preparatory courses "Dostyk", which helped me very much in admission and improved my knowledge in the field of mathematics,logic and English. I easily passed the passing test at the lyceum, but did not stop there. In the same year, the NIS school opened in Kostanay, and my parents insisted on entering this school, too. I didn't want to enroll, but I decided to test my knowledge. As a result, I entered both KTL and NIS. "NIS" started its work only with the 3rd quarter of the school year, then I decided to study at KTL for half a year, evaluate the school and its prospects, and then choose between these two schools. "KTL" is a very good school, I liked it because your classmates eventually become close to you as brothers, and teachers and educators are like your older brothers, who will help you at any time and give advice. I liked studying at NIS more, as the school was new, there were many prospects, foreign teachers and ways of self-realization. I don't regret finishing "NIS". It gave me a lot of useful skills, knowledge, and I also found friends and love there. Since the 9th grade, I dreamed of entering higher education in Almaty, in particular in "KBTU". I did not consider studying abroad, as it is very expensive and you can study abroad even after receiving a bachelor's degree to get a master's degree. However, at the last moment, I changed my mind and chose Nur-Sultan, or rather AITU University, for my bachelor's degree. The university is new, there are many opportunities and prospects here. Now I am a first-year student and my life path is just beginning.

<p>My family consists of 5 people. I am the oldest child in the family and I have a brother and sister. My parents are 47 years old for 2021, my little brother will be 15 this year, and my little sister will be 7. My parents have been divorced for a long time, but they continue to live together and support their children in every possible way. My mother was a teacher of the Kazakh language about 20 years ago, and now she works in a senior position in the Akimat of Kostanay. I don't have a very good relationship with my dad and I don't really like talking to him very much. My little brother followed in my footsteps and is now studying at NIS, and my little sister will only start the first grade this year. We love to travel as a family. It brings us together. Since I am the eldest child in the family, I am an indicator for them. Therefore, I need to work hard to help my family in the future.

<em>As a child, I did taekwondo and boxing, but I only did it for six months, because taekwondo was too much stress on my growing body, and after sparring in boxing, I had a bad headache. Then, at the initiative of my friend, I went to the football section. I played football for about 4 years and made a lot of friends. After entering KTL and NIS, I had to give up football because I didn't have enough time to train. At school, I learned to play table tennis and it became something of a small hobby. Then I started playing computer games, in particular World of tanks, GTA 5 and spent a lot of hours of my life on it, for which I now regret. Then I did some sambo training with my friend, but I didn't have enough time for that either, as I had to prepare for my final exams. However, since the 7th grade, I had a craving for iron, that is, I really liked working with weights and training my body. This is what I do to this day, but I have problems gaining muscle mass, due to the fact that I am an ectomorph. Also, now I want to learn how to write beats and then record my own track. In addition to this, I want to learn coding and further develop the field of IT technologies.

<p>I have a lot of friends from different schools and cities, as I am a sociable person and do not like to be alone. I have a good relationship with everyone and I have a lot of pleasant memories with everyone. Now many of them are studying in Almaty, some have entered abroad, and only a few have entered Nursultan. I have confidence in my friends, and I know that they can stand up for me and help me in a difficult moment. This is due to the fact that they have known me for a long time and we have been through a lot.</p>
